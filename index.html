  <h1>Hi, I'm Lauren Bentley</h1>
  <div class="row justify-content-end align-items-center">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p>I am a dedicated, hardworking student studying journalism at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. </p>
      <p>Alongside journalism, I am also studying Criminology and Criminal Justice as a double major.</p>
      <p>Over the past two years of college, I have expanded my journalistic and leadership skills with relevant coursework, experience with on-campus publications and leadership roles. </p>
      <p>I worked as a diversions reporter for a year and a half on The Diamondback, the universityâ€™s student-run newspaper.  I was responsible for covering campus entertainment events, while also writing commentaries on arts and pop culture. </p>
      <p>Additionally, I have enhanced my collaboration and communication skills through on-campus jobs I have held throughout my time at Maryland. I worked as an Office Assistant for the Terrapin Teachers program during my sophomore year. Furthermore, I currently work as a staff member at Ritchie Coliseum, an on-campus student gym. </p>
