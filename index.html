        <p>I am a dedicated, hardworking student studying journalism in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the
          University of Maryland, College Park. </p>
        <p>Alongside journalism, I am also studying Criminology and Criminal Justice as a double major.</p>
        <p>Over the past two years of college, I have expanded my journalistic and leadership skills with relevant
          coursework, experience with on-campus publications and various job opportunities. </p>
        <p>I worked as a diversions reporter on The Diamondback, the universityâ€™s student-run newspaper. I was
          responsible for covering campus entertainment events, while also writing commentaries on arts and pop culture.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, I have enhanced my collaboration and communication skills through on-campus jobs I've held
          throughout my time at Maryland. I worked as an Office Assistant for the Terrapin Teachers program during my
          sophomore year. Furthermore, I currently work part-time as a staff member at Ritchie Coliseum, an on-campus
          student gym.
